The goal was : 

-to create an AI model which will be able to recognize a movement (yes/no). First of all, I took some examples of yes/no movements produced by myself with the Arduino33BLE (thanks to the Gyroscope and the Accelerometer). I used that too build the model. I took 20 samples for each labels (yes/no). 

-Then, with the datas, I created my own model and I analyzed it.  


-Then, after the arduino implmentation, I've tryed to create a quizz in which the user can answer with the arduino by producing a movement. That was complicated for my to create a quizz and to understand completely the arduino code, Said GHANEM helped me for the arduino code. I tried to also implement a score that can be see during the quizz.
